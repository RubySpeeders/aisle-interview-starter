## Description

This app takes in a letter in an input and sends it to the server. The server evaluates whether or not the letter is valid and then sends a message back to the frontend to display whether or not the letter is valid.

The criteria for whether or not a letter is valid is music related -- all letters between A & G are valid, and all others are not.
